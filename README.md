## About Me

I'm Anwesha — an aspiring **Electrical Engineer** from Odisha University of Technology and Research (Class of 2027), driven by curiosity that spans **embedded systems, literature, psychology, and philosophy**.

When I'm not simulating circuits in Proteus or coding in Embedded C, you'll find me writing poems, managing literary communities, or diving deep into human emotions, ancient texts, and the ethics of modern society.
